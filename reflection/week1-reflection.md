# Complex Systems
*Week 1 Reflection*

This week's lecture ventured into the high-level definition of a complex system. Prior to the lecture, my idea of what a complex system is can be considered as very rudimentary. I used to consider complex systems as simply something that is representative of a certain process or phenomenon. However, even just after the indtroductory lecture, I've found that it is more of a specialized technique of understanding and modeling systems that have very specific dependencies and interactions.

I personally find complex systems a very interesting discipline as in my experience, a lot of business problems cannot be modeled in a satisfactory way given that they are not isolated processes. Most business problems are convoluted and are in reality, dependent on a number of things.

Specifically, one project that is usually requested by stakeholders is on competitor analysis and before, the only way I could imagine to implement this is through comparing prices and sales over time. however, I've always found this too simplistic. I now realize that having an understanding of complex systems and how to model this interrelationship between competitors could be very useful. In a way, being able to understand and model how each competitor interact and react to one another will provide very useful insights.

## Rules and Emergent Behavior
The activity on creating local, simple rules for certain scenarios was something I very much enjoyed, and enabled me to solidify my understanding of what a complex system is. The goal of the activity was to think about how we can come up with certain rules that will eventually lead to emergent behavior. Throughout the discussion of each group of their scenario, there was extensive focus on differentiating rules from emergent behavior.

Essentially, rules are locally applied. A rule is individually checked against each participant in the system. It is more so on the granular level of a system. In contrast, emergent behavior is the resulting pattern created by the local rules and interactions. It naturally arises in the system through the local rules and interactions.
